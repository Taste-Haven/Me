  About Me:
- I'm 14 years old
- I'm a student of Lynfield College, New Zealand
- I take digital technologies as a subject, so I'm still learning lots of stuff about coding

About my project:
- I’m currently working on a project called "Taste Haven"! The idea of this project is a website and an app where users can upload their own recipes and recipe collections (an article style page with multiple recipes that have a common theme, uses same ingredients, etc.), and other users can view them. You'll be able to save other's recipes to (only) your private collections.
- I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript
- I’m looking to collaborate on my Taste Haven project
- How to reach me: tastehaven@protonmail.com
- Fun fact: This whole project idea started from a school task where I had to make a web page with a couple recipes on it lol!
